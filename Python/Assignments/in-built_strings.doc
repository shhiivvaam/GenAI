In Built Strings Assignment

Question 1:  What is the purpose of the len() function in Python, and how can it be used with strings?

Answer: The purpose of the len() function in Python is to return the length of the string. 
        It can be used with strings by passing the string as an argument to the len() function. 
        For example, len("hello") will return 5, as the string "hello" has 5 characters.

Question 2: How can you concatenate two or more strings in Python, and can you provide an example of string 
concatenation?

Answer: The + operator can be used to concatenate two or more strings in Python. 
        For example, "hello" + "world" will result in the string "helloworld".
    
Question 3: What is string slicing in Python, and how can you extract a portion of a string using this method?

Answer: The string slicing in Python is a way to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices. 
        The syntax for string slicing is string[start:end], where start is the starting index and end is the ending index 
        (not inclusive). For example, "hello"[1:4] will return the string "ell".

Question 4: How can you change the case of a string in Python, and can you provide examples of both making a string 
all uppercase and all lowercase?

Answer: We can change the case of a string using { upper() and lower() } methods in Python.
        "Hello".upper() will return "HELLO"
        "Hello".lower() will return "hello".

Question 5: What does the split() method do in Python, and how can you split a string using a specific delimiter?

Answer: The split() method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter. 
        By default, the delimiter is a space character. 
        For example, "hello world".split() will return ['hello', 'world']. 
        To split a string using a specific delimiter, you can pass the delimiter as an argument to the split() method. 
        For example, "hello,world".split(",") will return ['hello', 'world'].
