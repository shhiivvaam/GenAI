However, it appears that the order is just `objs.keys()`.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\ndfa = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [\"A\"]})\\r\\ndfb = pd.DataFrame({\"B\": [\"B\"]})\\r\\n\\r\\nobjs = {\"Z\": dfa, \"Y\": dfb}\\r\\n\\r\\n# Expect these two to be the same\\r\\npd.concat(objs, axis=1)\\r\\n#    Z  Y\\r\\n#    A  B\\r\\n# 0  A  B\\r\\n\\r\\npd.concat(objs, axis=1, keys=sorted(objs.keys())\\r\\n#    Y  Z\\r\\n#    B  A\\r\\n# 0  B  A\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\nI think removed the statement of sortedness, not least because there is no requirement on the mapping input to have keys that admit a total order.',\n",

Note: We've chosen to ignore ES01 errors, these are not required to be fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. remove those methods from code_checks.sh if all errors are cleared and the docstring is correct, otherwise, remove the specific error that was fixed from the list of errors for that method.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. commit, push, open pull request\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease don't comment `take` as multiple people can work on this issue.

Currently, some methods fail some of these checks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### pandas.Series\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/c468028f5c2398c04d355cef7a8b6a3952620de2/ci/code_checks.sh#L318-L490\\r\\n\\r\\n#### The task is:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. take 1-5 methods\\r\\n\\r\\n2. run: `scripts/validate_docstrings.py --format=actions <method-name>`\\r\\n\\r\\n**example command:** `scripts/validate_docstrings.py --format=actions pandas.Categorical.__array__`\\r\\n**example output:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n################################## Validation ##################################\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n\\r\\n2 Errors found for `pandas.Categorical.__array__`:\\r\\n\\tES01\\tNo extended summary found\\r\\n\\tSA01\\tSee Also section not found\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. check if validation docstrings passes for those methods, and if it’s necessary fix the docstrings according to whatever error is reported. Note: We've chosen to ignore ES01 errors, these are not required to be fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. remove those methods from code_checks.sh if all errors are cleared and the docstring is correct, otherwise, remove the specific error that was fixed from the list of errors for that method.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. commit, push, open pull request\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease don't comment `take` as multiple people can work on this issue. You also don't need to ask for permission to work on this, just comment on which methods are you going to work : )\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're new contributor, please check the [contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks @datapythonista @jordan-d-murphy for the inspiration for this issue!\",\n",

       "  'body': \"# Motivation\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce numpy 2.0 becomes commonplace, users will probably try to pass in StringDType strings into pandas. As long as numpy is a required dependency of ours, I think it should make sense that we support these strings natively and not force conversion to object/Arrow. It'll also provide an alternative to needing Arrow to have a performant string dtype.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporting the new StringDType also has maintenance benefits, since it'll provide a path to getting rid of the object dtype that doesn't depend on requiring Arrow, because the string ufuncs that operate on StringDType are designed to match the Python semantics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it might be able to supplant the ``pyarrow_numpy`` dtype. Not sure what the plan for the ``pyarrow_numpy`` stuff will be long term, but I that if the performance of numpy strings are OK, we can just infer to them by default (if numpy is selected as the dtype backend).\\r\\n\\r\\n# Implementation Details\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that we'll probably want to discuss is the dtype naming conventions for pyarrow/numpy strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm really not a fan of the ``string[pyarrow_numpy]`` naming scheme (since there's ambiguity in this name as to whether the array is actually backed by an arrow or numpy array, since both are in the name :) ).\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe we can (deprecate) and rename this to something ``string[pyarrow_nplike]``, or just ``string[nplike]`` if we want to replace the ``pyarrow_numpy`` strings altogether\\r\\n(where ``nplike`` will default to numpy 2.0 if you have that installed, and fallback to Arrow if not installed, if the ``pyarrow_numpy`` dtype will go away in the future).\\r\\n\\r\\nPDEP-13 may also be tangentially related here (I haven't had the time to go through the discussion there yet though).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone have any thoughts on this?\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @pandas-dev/pandas-core @ngoldbaum (who I'm working with this on)\",\n",

Currently, some methods fail some of these checks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### pandas.Int16Dtype through pandas.IntervalIndex\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/c468028f5c2398c04d355cef7a8b6a3952620de2/ci/code_checks.sh#L231-L252\\r\\n\\r\\n**The task is:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. take 1-5 methods\\r\\n2. run: `scripts/validate_docstrings.py --format=actions <method-name>`\\r\\n\\r\\n**example command:** `scripts/validate_docstrings.py --format=actions pandas.Categorical.__array__` **example output:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n################################## Validation ##################################\\r\\n################################################################################\\r\\n\\r\\n2 Errors found for `pandas.Categorical.__array__`:\\r\\n\\tES01\\tNo extended summary found\\r\\n\\tSA01\\tSee Also section not found\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. check if validation docstrings passes for those methods, and if it’s necessary fix the docstrings according to whatever error is reported. **Note:** We've chosen to ignore ES01 errors, these are not required to be fixed.\\r\\n4. remove those methods from code_checks.sh if all errors are cleared and the docstring is correct, otherwise, remove the specific error that was fixed from the list of errors for that method.\\r\\n5. commit, push, open pull request\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease don't comment `take` as multiple people can work on this issue. You also don't need to ask for permission to work on this, just comment on which methods are you going to work : )\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're new contributor, please check the [contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks @datapythonista @jordan-d-murphy  for the inspiration for this issue!\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

This can lead to silent type errors, depending on the type-checker used. Consider the following example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nfrom pandas import Timedelta, Timestamp\\r\\n\\r\\nt: Timestamp = Timestamp(\"2024-04-29T18:00:00\")\\r\\nt2: Timestamp = Timestamp(np.datetime64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\ndt: Timedelta = Timedelta(1, \"h\")\\r\\ndt2: Timedelta = Timedelta(np.timedelta64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nType-checking results:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `mypy --strict`: No errors (w/ and w/o `pandas-stubs`)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = true`: 4 errors (only formally correct result)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = false`: no errors\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nIntroduce new constructors `timestamp` and `timedelta` (in analogy to how `pyarrow` does constructors), which are guaranteed to return `pd.Timestamp` and `pd.Timedelta` types, or raise an exception in the case when `NaT` is encountered.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nSplit `pd.NaT` into two different types, `Timestamp(\"NaT\")` and `Timedelta(\"NaT\")` (as is the case in `numpy`), which are instances of the respective types.
