       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)\\n\\n\\n### Location of the documentation\\n\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.concat.html\\n\\n### Documentation problem\\n\\nThe `objs` parameter is described as:\\r\\n```\\r\\nobjs: an iterable or mapping of Series or DataFrame objects\\r\\n\\r\\n    If a mapping is passed, the sorted keys will be used as the keys argument, \\r\\n    unless it is passed, in which case the values will be selected (see below). \\r\\n    Any None objects will be dropped silently unless they are all None in \\r\\n    which case a ValueError will be raised.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMy reading of this is that if I pass a dictionary of objects, then the order of the result of the concatenation will be given by `sorted(objs.keys())` (if I don\\'t pass `keys=`). However, it appears that the order is just `objs.keys()`.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\ndfa = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [\"A\"]})\\r\\ndfb = pd.DataFrame({\"B\": [\"B\"]})\\r\\n\\r\\nobjs = {\"Z\": dfa, \"Y\": dfb}\\r\\n\\r\\n# Expect these two to be the same\\r\\npd.concat(objs, axis=1)\\r\\n#    Z  Y\\r\\n#    A  B\\r\\n# 0  A  B\\r\\n\\r\\npd.concat(objs, axis=1, keys=sorted(objs.keys())\\r\\n#    Y  Z\\r\\n#    B  A\\r\\n# 0  B  A\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\nI think removed the statement of sortedness, not least because there is no requirement on the mapping input to have keys that admit a total order.',\n",

       "  'body': \"# Motivation\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce numpy 2.0 becomes commonplace, users will probably try to pass in StringDType strings into pandas. As long as numpy is a required dependency of ours, I think it should make sense that we support these strings natively and not force conversion to object/Arrow. It'll also provide an alternative to needing Arrow to have a performant string dtype.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporting the new StringDType also has maintenance benefits, since it'll provide a path to getting rid of the object dtype that doesn't depend on requiring Arrow, because the string ufuncs that operate on StringDType are designed to match the Python semantics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it might be able to supplant the ``pyarrow_numpy`` dtype. Not sure what the plan for the ``pyarrow_numpy`` stuff will be long term, but I that if the performance of numpy strings are OK, we can just infer to them by default (if numpy is selected as the dtype backend).\\r\\n\\r\\n# Implementation Details\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that we'll probably want to discuss is the dtype naming conventions for pyarrow/numpy strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm really not a fan of the ``string[pyarrow_numpy]`` naming scheme (since there's ambiguity in this name as to whether the array is actually backed by an arrow or numpy array, since both are in the name :) ).\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe we can (deprecate) and rename this to something ``string[pyarrow_nplike]``, or just ``string[nplike]`` if we want to replace the ``pyarrow_numpy`` strings altogether\\r\\n(where ``nplike`` will default to numpy 2.0 if you have that installed, and fallback to Arrow if not installed, if the ``pyarrow_numpy`` dtype will go away in the future).\\r\\n\\r\\nPDEP-13 may also be tangentially related here (I haven't had the time to go through the discussion there yet though).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone have any thoughts on this?\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @pandas-dev/pandas-core @ngoldbaum (who I'm working with this on)\",\n",

This can lead to silent type errors, depending on the type-checker used. Consider the following example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nfrom pandas import Timedelta, Timestamp\\r\\n\\r\\nt: Timestamp = Timestamp(\"2024-04-29T18:00:00\")\\r\\nt2: Timestamp = Timestamp(np.datetime64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\ndt: Timedelta = Timedelta(1, \"h\")\\r\\ndt2: Timedelta = Timedelta(np.timedelta64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nType-checking results:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `mypy --strict`: No errors (w/ and w/o `pandas-stubs`)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = true`: 4 errors (only formally correct result)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = false`: no errors\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nIntroduce new constructors `timestamp` and `timedelta` (in analogy to how `pyarrow` does constructors), which are guaranteed to return `pd.Timestamp` and `pd.Timedelta` types, or raise an exception in the case when `NaT` is encountered.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nSplit `pd.NaT` into two different types, `Timestamp(\"NaT\")` and `Timedelta(\"NaT\")` (as is the case in `numpy`), which are instances of the respective types.

Description\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen trying to concatenate by column few non overlapping timeseries dataframes, if the units of the original dataframes are not \\'ns\\' then the resulting dataframe will have missing data (and lose it\\'s frequency value, in case it\\'s relevant).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example given has 3 dataframes and for some reason the result has missed most of the data from the first and the second dataframe. In case of concatenating 2 dataframes we end up with almost no data at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we set the units to \\'ns\\' everything works as expected, the resulting df has all the data and kept its frequency=\\'5min\\'. Every other unit I tried failed with similar results than the example.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\nidx1 = pd.date_range(\"2024-01-01\",

       "  'body': '### Feature Type\\n\\n- [ ] Adding new functionality to pandas\\n\\n- [X] Changing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n- [ ] Removing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n\\n### Problem Description\\n\\nThe `read_csv` has a parameter `date_format` which can can be \"str or dict of columns\", see [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#:~:text=str%20or%20dict%20of%20column).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for parsing date columns you can either use:\\r\\n* str = all columns have the same datetime format\\r\\n* dict = explicitly specify the datetime format for every individual datetime column\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in practise a csv file with different datetime formats, usually it\\'s just either a date or a datetime (or time) format. In other words the date format can differ a lot for different csv files, but usually it doesn\\'t differ that much within one file. Theoretically there could be US and European date formats mixed in one csv file, but I work with a lot of csv data and I\\'ve never seen this. From my expericence this is a very uncommon use-case.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nSo for example, a csv file can have 10 date columns formatted like `01-05-2024` and 5 columns formatted like `05-05-2024 12:30`.\\r\\nReading such a csv file with `read_csv` with many datetime columns, just the `str` parameter is not sufficient but the `dict` parameter is a bit overkill because you have to explicitly set the format for each column when basically there are just two groups, so it\\'s not very practical.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo my feature request is:\\r\\n\\r\\nCan the read_csv be updated so that the `date_format` parameter also accepts just a list of dateformat strings for the date columns? So for example `date_format=[\\'%d-%m-%Y\\', \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\']`\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nAlternatively, I think it could be practical for most typical use-cases to give groups of dateformats. So instead of having to supply a parameter for each individual column, like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'incdate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'dob\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'visitdate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat1\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat2\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat3\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat4\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat5\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake1\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake2\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake3\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake4\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake5\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\'}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be changed so you have to supply groups like this, which is less code and more reflecting the actual situation:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\': [\\'incdate\\', \\'visitdate\\'],\\r\\n             \\'%d-%m-%Y\\': [\\'dob\\', \\'ther_startdat1\\', \\'ther_startdat2\\', \\'ther_startdat3\\', \\'ther_startdat4\\', \\'ther_startdat5\\'],\\r\\n             \\'%H:%M:%S\\': [\\'dob\\', \\'ther_uptake1\\', \\'ther_uptake2\\', \\'ther_uptake3\\', \\'ther_uptake4\\', \\'ther_uptake5\\']\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nSee code examples below for typical csv files with date values (it is all randomly generated test data)\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n# Library\\r\\nimport io\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\n# load data hard coded, for eaxmple\\r\\nstr_cardio = \"\"\"TestDate;Protocol;CustomId;SubjectId;BirthDate;Gender;TestStage;Duration;AvgHeartRate;AvgLoad\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Warmup;151;85,1;26,5\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Training;1352;113,8;52,6\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Recovery;256;86,2;5,4\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Warmup;110;64,9;64,3\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Training;2485;144,3;128,4\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Recovery;265;101,0;12,8\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Warmup;108;53,2;38,8\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Training;948;115,0;77,6\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Recovery;235;74,5;7,8\\r\\n\"\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n# no date time hints, TestDate and BirthDate imported as string `object`\\r\\n#df_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep = \";\", decimal=\",\")\\r\\n#print(df_cardio.dtypes)\\r\\n\\r\\n# datetime columns\\r\\ncol_dates = [\\'TestDate\\', \\'BirthDate\\']\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'TestDate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'BirthDate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\'}\\r\\n\\r\\n# read csv file\\r\\n#df_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep=\\';\\', decimal=\\',\\', header=0, parse_dates=col_dates, date_format=date_formats)\\r\\n#f_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep=\\';\\', decimal=\\',\\', header=0, parse_dates=col_dates, date_format=[\\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\', \\'%H:%M:%S\\']) #
