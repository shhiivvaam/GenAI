This can lead to silent type errors, depending on the type-checker used. Consider the following example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nfrom pandas import Timedelta, Timestamp\\r\\n\\r\\nt: Timestamp = Timestamp(\"2024-04-29T18:00:00\")\\r\\nt2: Timestamp = Timestamp(np.datetime64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\ndt: Timedelta = Timedelta(1, \"h\")\\r\\ndt2: Timedelta = Timedelta(np.timedelta64(\"nat\"))  # actually NaTType!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nType-checking results:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `mypy --strict`: No errors (w/ and w/o `pandas-stubs`)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = true`: 4 errors (only formally correct result)\\r\\n- `pyright` with `useLibraryCodeForTypes = false`: no errors\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nIntroduce new constructors `timestamp` and `timedelta` (in analogy to how `pyarrow` does constructors), which are guaranteed to return `pd.Timestamp` and `pd.Timedelta` types, or raise an exception in the case when `NaT` is encountered.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nSplit `pd.NaT` into two different types, `Timestamp(\"NaT\")` and `Timedelta(\"NaT\")` (as is the case in `numpy`), which are instances of the respective types.

overlapping timeseries dataframes, if the unites of the original dataframes are not \\'ns\\' then the resulting dataframe will have missing data (and lose it\\'s frequency value, in case it\\'s relevant).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example given has 3 dataframes and for some reason the result has missed most of the data from the first and the second dataframe. In case of concatenating 2 dataframes we end up with almost no data at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we set the units to \\'ns\\' everything works as expected, the resulting df has all the data and kept its frequency=\\'5min\\'. Every other unit I tried failed with similar results than the example.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\nidx1 = pd.date_range(\"2024-01-01\", periods=24*12,

       "  'body': '### Feature Type\\n\\n- [ ] Adding new functionality to pandas\\n\\n- [X] Changing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n- [ ] Removing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n\\n### Problem Description\\n\\nThe `read_csv` has a parameter `date_format` which can can be \"str or dict of columns\", see [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#:~:text=str%20or%20dict%20of%20column).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for parsing date columns you can either use:\\r\\n* str = all columns have the same datetime format\\r\\n* dict = explicitly specify the datetime format for every individual datetime column\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in practise a csv file with different datetime formats, usually it\\'s just either a date or a datetime (or time) format. In other words the date format can differ a lot for different csv files, but usually it doesn\\'t differ that much within one file. Theoretically there could be US and European date formats mixed in one csv file, but I work with a lot of csv data and I\\'ve never seen this. From my expericence this is a very uncommon use-case.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nSo for example, a csv file can have 10 date columns formatted like `01-05-2024` and 5 columns formatted like `05-05-2024 12:30`.\\r\\nReading such a csv file with `read_csv` with many datetime columns, just the `str` parameter is not sufficient but the `dict` parameter is a bit overkill because you have to explicitly set the format for each column when basically there are just two groups, so it\\'s not very practical.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo my feature request is:\\r\\n\\r\\nCan the read_csv be updated so that the `date_format` parameter also accepts just a list of dateformat strings for the date columns? So for example `date_format=[\\'%d-%m-%Y\\', \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\']`\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nAlternatively, I think it could be practical for most typical use-cases to give groups of dateformats. So instead of having to supply a parameter for each individual column, like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'incdate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'dob\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'visitdate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat1\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat2\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat3\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat4\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_startdat5\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake1\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake2\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake3\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake4\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'ther_uptake5\\': \\'%H:%M:%S\\'}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could be changed so you have to supply groups like this, which is less code and more reflecting the actual situation:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\': [\\'incdate\\', \\'visitdate\\'],\\r\\n             \\'%d-%m-%Y\\': [\\'dob\\', \\'ther_startdat1\\', \\'ther_startdat2\\', \\'ther_startdat3\\', \\'ther_startdat4\\', \\'ther_startdat5\\'],\\r\\n             \\'%H:%M:%S\\': [\\'dob\\', \\'ther_uptake1\\', \\'ther_uptake2\\', \\'ther_uptake3\\', \\'ther_uptake4\\', \\'ther_uptake5\\']\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nSee code examples below for typical csv files with date values (it is all randomly generated test data)\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n# Library\\r\\nimport io\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\n# load data hard coded, for eaxmple\\r\\nstr_cardio = \"\"\"TestDate;Protocol;CustomId;SubjectId;BirthDate;Gender;TestStage;Duration;AvgHeartRate;AvgLoad\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Warmup;151;85,1;26,5\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Training;1352;113,8;52,6\\r\\n22-4-2024 17:31:13;Long HIIT 55W 45 sec.;;75110500;26-1-1970;Male;Recovery;256;86,2;5,4\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Warmup;110;64,9;64,3\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Training;2485;144,3;128,4\\r\\n19-4-2024 16:17:32;Long HIIT 130W 45 sec.;;85775845;19-4-2024;Male;Recovery;265;101,0;12,8\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Warmup;108;53,2;38,8\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Training;948;115,0;77,6\\r\\n17-4-2024 11:58:03;ONCO Interval 70- 90 (3.00-4.00);;23251624;12-11-1969;Female;Recovery;235;74,5;7,8\\r\\n\"\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n# no date time hints, TestDate and BirthDate imported as string `object`\\r\\n#df_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep = \";\", decimal=\",\")\\r\\n#print(df_cardio.dtypes)\\r\\n\\r\\n# datetime columns\\r\\ncol_dates = [\\'TestDate\\', \\'BirthDate\\']\\r\\ndate_formats = {\\'TestDate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\',\\r\\n             \\'BirthDate\\': \\'%d-%m-%Y\\'}\\r\\n\\r\\n# read csv file\\r\\n#df_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep=\\';\\', decimal=\\',\\', header=0, parse_dates=col_dates, date_format=date_formats)\\r\\n#f_cardio = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(str_cardio), sep=\\';\\', decimal=\\',\\', header=0, parse_dates=col_dates, date_format=[\\'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\\', \\'%H:%M:%S\\']) #
